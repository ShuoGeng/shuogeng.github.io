+ **Solving an NNP problem by means of Quantum Optics**
  School of ECE, Purdue University(Online) (December 2022 – June 2023(expected))
  - Introduction:The project plan aims to tackle some typical NP problems (such as the MAX-CUT problem) by utilizing optical
    parametric oscillators (OPOs) or OPO networks. The proposed approach involves abstracting the target problem as an Ising
    spin system and then using OPO (networks) to search the Hamiltonian ground state energy to solve the target problem.
  - Project Progress: Following the idea proposed in the paper to build a neural network using TensorFlow and train it in colab,
    the target effect was successfully reproduced (the training trend was the same as the effect in the paper) and the prediction
    could be successfully made.
+ **Reproduction of optical design projects based on reverse learning**
  School of Physical Science and Technology (April 2022 – March 2023)
  - Introduction:The goal of this project is to replicate the findings of an article authored by Yu Zongfu’s team. When we
    encounter a partial optical structure with corresponding electromagnetic correspondence, we will employ a tandem architecture
    that combines forward modeling and inverse design to create an optical system.
  - Project Progress: By following the approach suggested in the paper, we constructed a neural network using TensorFlow and
    trained it in Google Colab. We successfully replicated the desired effect (the training trend closely matched that reported in the
    paper) and were able to make accurate predictions.
+ **Palm print identification**
  School of Information Science and Engineering (November 2021 – March 2022)
  - Introduction:This project utilizes publicly available datasets to develop a palmprint identification system that aims to achieve
    high accuracy in distinguishing the owner of a given palmprint, which is a practice project for learning neural networks.
  - Project Progress:After conducting extensive research, I discovered that By selecting appropriate parameters and applying
    adaptive binarization to the database photos, they were successfully classified with a slightly modified SVM, with an accuracy
    rate exceeding 98%
+ **Exploration of the nature and causes of candle flame oscillator**
  School of Physical Science and Technology (October 2020 – September 2021)
  - Introduction:In this project, we aim to investigate the coupling conditions and underlying causes of flame oscillations when
    several candles are burning in close proximity to one another.
  - Project Progress:After reviewing the relevant literature and deriving the necessary theoretical framework, we utilized OpenCV
    and a thermometer to collect experimental data that closely aligned with the proposed theory.
  - Participated in China Undergraduate Physics Tournament(Northwest Region) as a tournament topic and won the first prize in
    June 2021.
