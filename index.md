# About Me

Welcome to my personal website! I am Shuo Geng, currently a junior undergraduate student at Lanzhou University, majoring in physics and will receive my Bachelor of Science degree in the fall semester of 2024. I have been actively involved in research projects, primarily in the field of **non linear physics, condensed matter physics and quantum computation**. I have also taken a diverse range of courses in physics, optics, computers, and mathematics, and have been privileged to serve as a teaching assistant for some courses.

For more detailed information about my academic and research experiences, please refer to the [Education](#Education), [Research](#RE), and [Teaching Assistantship](#TA) sections of this website. Alternatively, you can also view my [CV](./CV/CV_ZhipingWang_May.pdf). for a summary of my achievements.

# Research experiences <a name="RE"></a>
The listed content here is just a partial enumeration of experiences. If you would like to learn more details, please click [here](./research.md).
  
+ **Based on Kunpeng full-stack software and hardware platform technology, explore creative products that apply technology to specific industry scenarios** 

Specific research content: Based on Kunpeng software and hardware, such as Kunpeng 920 CPU, code migration toolkit, Huawei MindSpore compiler, and performance tuning tools, the molecular dynamics application software GROMACS and LAMMPS will be ported and optimized. This aims to provide reliable computing solutions for the Kunpeng full-stack computing architecture in the fields of materials and drug design.

In this project, the PLpro protein of the coronavirus is used as a research example, and its conformational changes in an aqueous solution are simulated using GROMACS. The computational results can contribute to the subsequent development of drugs for the coronavirus. Simultaneously, through studying the frictional dynamics of carbon-hydrogen thin films, the research explores machine lubricant materials for vacuum environments.

Collge of Chemistry and chemical Engineering, Lanzhou University (March-September 202`)
  
+ **The computation of Tensor Networks**
I have studied some knowledge and computational methods of Tensor Networks and conducted partial calculations. For more details, please visit GitHub: ShuoGeng/Some-Basic-Tensor-Calculations (github.com). The project is still being updated.

The following tasks have been accomplished:

Obtained corresponding matrices for two arbitrary-dimensional vectors using Givens and Householder transformation methods.

Calculated the ground-state energy, energy gap, and specific heat of a spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain with U(1) symmetry.

Completed the Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) of matrices.

Utilized the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm to compute the ground-state energy and average energy of a spin-1/2 spin chain.
